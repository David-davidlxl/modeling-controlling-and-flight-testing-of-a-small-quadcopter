ReadMe file for asbQuadcopterRealFlight (version 1)

Starting with asbQuadcopter (original), the following changes are made to get to this version:

1) complete the input and output configuration steps described in section 4.2 of the Honors Report

2) get rid of the take-off and landing mechanisms as described in section 5.4.1 of the Honors Report

3) create the constant-altitude scenario (with a reference value of -0.7 m and duration of 10 s) as described in section 5.4.2 of the Honors Report

4) comment out the Video Viwer block to prevent live script output as described in appendix B of the Honors Report

5) perform a real flight (as described in section 6.2) for the constant-altitude scenario and download the flight log and MAT-file
